                <div class="faq-question">2. Are Samsung smartwatches compatible with iPhones?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes, Samsung smartwatches are compatible with iPhones. However, it is important to note that the functionality is somewhat limited compared to pairing with Android devices. While core features like notifications, fitness tracking, and music controls will work, certain functionalities such as Samsung Pay and advanced health monitoring tools like ECG might not be supported.

                <div class="faq-answer">Battery life varies based on the model and how the smartwatch is used. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 offers up to 40 hours of battery life under standard usage conditions, which includes occasional GPS usage, notifications, and health tracking. For heavy usage scenarios, such as continuous workout tracking or streaming music, the battery might last less.

This feature is especially useful for users who are frequently on the move and need to stay connected. For Bluetooth models, you can make and receive calls as long as the watch is paired with your smartphone via Bluetooth. The built-in microphone and speaker on most Samsung smartwatches ensure clear audio quality for calls, making it a convenient alternative to your phone in many situations.</div>
